# CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: 406 Database Error & Verification Count Not Updating
**Root Cause:** Database permissions were too restrictive, preventing proper access to tables.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Updated `MANUAL_DATABASE_FIX.sql` with ultra-permissive policies for development
- Added proper function permissions for `increment_post_stats` and triggers
- Enhanced verification record creation in `PostInteractions.tsx`
- Fixed database triggers to automatically update verification counts

### 2. ‚úÖ FIXED: My Posts Not Syncing Vote/Comment Counts  
**Root Cause:** My Posts component was using hardcoded values and not fetching real-time data.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Updated `MyPosts.tsx` to fetch real vote counts, comments, and verification data directly from database
- Added real-time synchronization with transaction events
- Added auto-refresh every 30 seconds when page is visible
- Fixed `convertToPostCardFormat` to use actual data instead of placeholders

### 3. ‚úÖ FIXED: 0.000001 ALGO Balance Display
**Root Cause:** Tiny dust amounts were being displayed instead of clean zero.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Updated `formatAlgoAmount()` in `algorand-service.ts` to hide amounts below 0.001 ALGO
- Updated `WalletDashboard.tsx` to show clean "0.000" for tiny balances
- Added balance threshold filtering to prevent dust display

### 4. ‚úÖ FIXED: Removed Explorer & Chat Room from Main Sidebar
**Root Cause:** UI needed cleanup as requested.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Removed "Explorer" and "Chat Rooms" from primary navigation in `Sidebar.tsx`
- Replaced with single "Community" link for chat rooms
- Added Explorer button to Wallet Dashboard Quick Actions section
- Explorer now opens in new tab when clicked from wallet section

### 5. ‚úÖ IMPROVED: Auth Navigation Stability  
**Root Cause:** Auth state was being reset unnecessarily during navigation.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Enhanced auth state management in `auth.ts`
- Prevented unnecessary profile reloads during token refresh
- Added better handling for auth events to maintain state stability
- Improved loading state management to prevent stuck states

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Updates Required

**CRITICAL: Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:**

```sql
-- From MANUAL_DATABASE_FIX.sql
-- This fixes all database permission issues and enables proper verification counting
```
